	abstract = {Entity matching ({EM}) is the most critical step for entity resolution ({ER}). While current deep learning-based methods achieve very impressive performance on standard {EM} benchmarks, their real-world application performance is much frustrating. In this paper, we highlight that such the gap between reality and ideality stems from the unreasonable benchmark construction process, which is inconsistent with the nature of entity matching and therefore leads to biased evaluations of current {EM} approaches. To this end, we build a new {EM} corpus and re-construct {EM} benchmarks to challenge critical assumptions implicit in the previous benchmark construction process by step-wisely changing the restricted entities, balanced labels, and single-modal records in previous benchmarks into open entities, imbalanced labels, and multi-modal records in an open environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the assumptions made in the previous benchmark construction process are not coincidental with the open environment, which conceal the main challenges of the task and therefore significantly overestimate the current progress of entity matching. The constructed benchmarks and code are publicly released at https://github.com/tshu-w/ember.},
